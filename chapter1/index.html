      My favorite drink is a White Peppermint Mocha. For some, its only a drink
      they enjoy during the holiday season, but I love it all year long! The
      white chocolate is sweet and rich, and the peppermint is refreshing at the
      same time. It is my go-to drink on a cold day because it is warm, sweet,
      and reminds me of the holidays! Even on warm days, I'll order it iced or
      blended for a cool refreshing treat!
